### Overview  
I am a Lecturer at the [Systems Immunity University Research Institute](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/systems-immunity) and the Division of Infection & Immunity, [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/), an Adjunct Professor/Docent at the [Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-of-medicine) and the chair of the [British Society for Immunology (BSI) South Wales regional group](http://www.immunology.org/south-wales-immunology-group). Over the course of my career, I have worked for, the World Health Organization, the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare, and the Chinese State Key Laboratory of Virology. These positions have led to impactful presentations at major conferences (e.g., WHO meeting in Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity; EU Framework 7 project meeting) and several scientific awards including a Young Scientist Award from a biennial international forum, [Nordic Lipid Forum](https://lipidforum.info/). My research interest is using _**data-driven informatics**_ to understand metabolic inflammation, focusing on, but not limited to,  **fatty liver disease**. 

On a personal level, I like problem solving, brainstorming ideas and contributing to active research discussions. I would therefore very much appreciate opportunities to work with people from _**different disciplines**_.

During my leisure time, I like doing sports such as badminton, swimming and ping-pong.
