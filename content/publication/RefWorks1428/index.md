abstract = "BACKGROUND: The association between ADIPOQ polymorphisms and the risk of obesity remains controversial. We perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to clarify the current understanding of this association. METHODS: We searched for relevant studies in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane library before February 2014. The strengths of the association between ADIPOQ polymorphisms and obesity risk were estimated by odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Eighteen case-control studies analyzing four SNPs (rs17300539, rs266729, rs1501299 and rs2241766) of ADIPOQ gene were eligible for the present meta-analysis. The pooling results showed that rs17300539 (2GG+GA vs. 2AA+GA: OR=0.78, 95%CI=0.69-0.89) and rs1501299 (2GG+GA vs. 2AA+GA: OR=0.89, 95%CI=0.80-0.98) were associated with obesity risk in Caucasian ethnicity. The rs266729 were associated with obesity risk in Asian ethnicity (2CC+CG vs. 2GG+GCG: OR=0.77, 95%CI=0.65-0.92). However, there were no associations between rs2241766 and the obesity risk (P>0.05). No publication bias was found among these studies (all P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that ADIPOQ rs17300539 and rs1501299 are associated with risk of obesity in Caucasian ethnicity, and the rs266729 is associated with obesity risk in Asian ethnicity. However, there is no association between rs2241766 and obesity risk."
