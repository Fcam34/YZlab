abstract = "No previous study has reported the association of osteopontin polymorphisms with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) risk. We aimed to investigate the association in a Chinese population. Four variants of osteopontin, rs11730582, rs1126772, rs9138, and rs4754 polymorphisms, were assessed in a case-control study which consists of 108 NPC patients and 210 health controls, by using polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Serum osteopontin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The serum osteopontin levels were significantly higher in NPC patients than those in controls (P0.05). The variant rs11730582 of osteopontin is associated with NPC risk. It potentially serves as a genetic marker of NPC predisposition."
