The actions of PGE2 on the development and functif Treg cells, particularly under inflammatory conditions, are debated. In this study, we employed pharmacological and genetic approaches to examine whether PGE2 had a direct action on T cells to modulate de novo differentiation of Treg cells. We found that TGF-beta-induced Foxp3 expression and iTreg cell differentiation in vitro is markedly inhibited by PGE2 , which was mediated by the receptors EP2 and EP4. Mechanistically, PGE2 -EP2/EP4 signalling interrupts TGF-beta signalling during iTreg differentiation. Moreover, EP4 deficiency in T cells impaired iTreg cell differentiation in vivo. Thus, our results demonstrate that PGE2 negatively regulates iTreg cell differentiation through a direct action on T cells, highlighting the potential for selectively targeting the PGE2 -EP2/EP4 pathway to control T cell-mediated inflammation.","tags":["ep receptors"," foxp3"," inflammation"," prostaglandin e2"," regulatory t cell"," tgf-beta"],"title":"Prostaglandin E2 directly inhibits the conversion of inducible regulatory T cells through EP2 and EP4 receptors via antagonizing TGF-beta signalling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Knock-down of STIM1 or ORAI1 attenuated SOCE, reduced invasion, and the expression of promigratory sphingosine 1-phosphate and vascular endothelial growth factor-2 receptors in thyroid cancer ML-1 cells. Cell proliferation was attenuated in these knock-down cells due to increased G1 phase of the cell cycle and enhanced expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory proteins p21 and p27. STIM1 protein was upregulated in thyroid cancer tissue, compared to normal tissue. Downregulation of STIM1 restored expression of thyroid stimulating hormone receptor, thyroid specific proteins and increased iodine uptake. STIM1 knockdown ML-1 cells were more susceptible to chemotherapeutic drugs, and significantly reduced tumor growth in Zebrafish. Furthermore, STIM1-siRNA-loaded mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles attenuated invasion and proliferation of ML-1 cells. Taken together, our data suggest that STIM1 is a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for treatment of thyroid cancer.","tags":["adolescent"," adult"," aged"," aged, 80 and over"," animals"," calcium channels/genetics"," calcium signaling/drug effects/genetics"," cell line, tumor"," cell proliferation/drug effects/genetics"," female"," g1 phase/drug effects/genetics"," humans"," indoles/administration \u0026 dosage"," male"," middle aged"," nanoparticles/administration \u0026 dosage"," neoplasm proteins/genetics"," orai1 protein/genetics"," polymers/administration \u0026 dosage"," rna, small interfering/administration \u0026 dosage"," stromal interaction molecule 1/genetics"," thyroid epithelial cells/drug effects/pathology"," thyroid gland/drug effects/pathology"," thyroid neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/pathology"," up-regulation/drug effects/genetics"," young adult"," zebrafish"," invasion"," migration"," orai1 calcium channel"," proliferation"," store-operated calcium entry (soce)"," stromal interaction molecule 1 (stim1)"," thyroid cancer"],"title":"Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) knock down attenuates invasion and proliferation and enhances the expression of thyroid-specific proteins in human follicular thyroid cancer cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

GCGR blockade hasn demonstrated to induce hypoglycemia, hyperaminoacidemia, hyperglucagonemia, decreased adiposity, hepatosteatosis, and pancreatic alpha cells hyperplasia in organisms. However, the mechanism of how GCGR regulates these physiological functions is not yet very clear. In our previous study, we revealed that GCGR regulated metabolic network at transcriptional level by RNA-seq using GCGR mutant zebrafish (gcgr (-/-)). Here, we further performed whole-organism metabolomics and lipidomics profiling on wild-type and gcgr (-/-) zebrafish to study the changes of metabolites. We found 107 significantly different metabolites from metabolomics analysis and 87 significantly different lipids from lipidomics analysis. Chemical substance classification and pathway analysis integrated with transcriptomics data both revealed that amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism were remodeled in gcgr-deficient zebrafish. Similar to other studies, our study showed that gcgr (-/-) zebrafish exhibited decreased ureagenesis and impaired cholesterol metabolism. More interestingly, we found that the glycerophospholipid metabolism was disrupted, the arachidonic acid metabolism was up-regulated, and the tryptophan metabolism pathway was down-regulated in gcgr (-/-) zebrafish. Based on the omics data, we further validated our findings by revealing that gcgr (-/-) zebrafish exhibited dampened melatonin diel rhythmicity and increased locomotor activity. These global omics data provide us a better understanding about the role of GCGR in regulating metabolic network and new insight into GCGR physiological functions.","tags":["glucagon"," glucagon receptor"," lipidomics"," metabolomics"," zebrafish"],"title":"Integrated Metabolomics and Lipidomics Analysis Reveal Remodeling of Lipid Metabolism and Amino Acid Metabolism in Glucagon Receptor-Deficient Zebrafish","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

Therefore, ANGPTL3 is a promising therapy target. We characterized the impacts of ANGPTL3 depletion on the immortalized human hepatocyte (IHH) transcriptome, lipidome and human plasma lipoprotein lipidome. The transcriptome of ANGPTL3 knock-down (KD) cells showed altered expression of several pathways related to lipid metabolism. Accordingly, ANGPTL3 depleted IHH displayed changes in cellular overall fatty acid (FA) composition and in the lipid species composition of several lipid classes, characterized by abundant n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs). This PUFA increase coincided with an elevation of lipid mediators, among which there were species relevant for resolution of inflammation, protection from lipotoxic and hypoxia-induced ER stress, hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance or for the recovery from cardiovascular events. Cholesterol esters were markedly reduced in ANGPTL3 KD IHH, coinciding with suppression of the SOAT1 mRNA and protein. ANGPTL3 LOF caused alterations in plasma lipoprotein FA and lipid species composition. All lipoprotein fractions of the ANGPTL3 LOF subjects displayed a marked drop of 18:2n-6, while several highly unsaturated triacylglycerol (TAG) species were enriched. The present work reveals distinct impacts of ANGPTL3 depletion on the hepatocellular lipidome, transcriptome and lipid mediators, as well as on the lipidome of lipoproteins isolated from plasma of ANGPTL3-deficient human subjects. It is important to consider these lipidomics and transcriptomics findings when targeting ANGPTL3 for therapy and translating it to the human context.","tags":["angiopoietin like 3"," cholesterol ester"," lipid metabolism"," lipidomics"," lipoprotein lipase"," polyunsaturated fatty acid"],"title":"ANGPTL3 deficiency alters the lipid profile and metabolism of cultured hepatocytes and human lipoproteins","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

However, li comprise large numbers of structurally related molecules not measured in traditional risk measurements, and many have inflammatory bioactivities. Here, we applied lipidomic and genomic approaches to 3 model systems to characterize lipid metabolic changes in common Chr9p21 SNPs, which confer approximately 30% elevated coronary heart disease risk associated with altered expression of ANRIL, a long ncRNA. METHODS: Untargeted and targeted lipidomics was applied to plasma from NPHSII (Northwick Park Heart Study II) homozygotes for AA or GG in rs10757274, followed by correlation and network analysis. To identify candidate genes, transcriptomic data from shRNA downregulation of ANRIL in HEK-293 cells was mined. Transcriptional data from vascular smooth muscle cells differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells of individuals with/without Chr9p21 risk, nonrisk alleles, and corresponding knockout isogenic lines were next examined. Last, an in-silico analysis of miRNAs was conducted to identify how ANRIL might control lysoPL (lysophosphospholipid)/lysoPA (lysophosphatidic acid) genes. RESULTS: Elevated risk GG correlated with reduced lysoPLs, lysoPA, and ATX (autotaxin). Five other risk SNPs did not show this phenotype. LysoPL-lysoPA interconversion was uncoupled from ATX in GG plasma, suggesting metabolic dysregulation. Significantly altered expression of several lysoPL/lysoPA metabolizing enzymes was found in HEK cells lacking ANRIL. In the vascular smooth muscle cells data set, the presence of risk alleles associated with altered expression of several lysoPL/lysoPA enzymes. Deletion of the risk locus reversed the expression of several lysoPL/lysoPA genes to nonrisk haplotype levels. Genes that were altered across both cell data sets were DGKA, MBOAT2, PLPP1, and LPL. The in-silico analysis identified 4 ANRIL-regulated miRNAs that control lysoPL genes as miR-186-3p, miR-34a-3p, miR-122-5p, and miR-34a-5p. CONCLUSIONS: A Chr9p21 risk SNP associates with complex alterations in immune-bioactive phospholipids and their metabolism. Lipid metabolites and genomic pathways associated with coronary heart disease pathogenesis in Chr9p21 and ANRIL-associated disease are demonstrated.","tags":["atherosclerosis"," lipids"," mass spectrometry"," phenotype"," phospholipids"],"title":"Metabolic Dysregulation of the Lysophospholipid/Autotaxin Axis in the Chromosome 9p21 Gene SNP rs10757274","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

The liver is enriched with polyunsaturated triglycerides (PUFA-TGs) in PNPLA3-I148M carriers. Gene ression data indicate that PNPLA3 is liver-specific in humans, but whether it functions in adipose tissue (AT) is unknown. We investigated whether PNPLA3-I148M modifies AT metabolism in human NAFLD. METHODS: Profiling of the AT lipidome and fasting serum non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) composition was conducted in 125 volunteers (PNPLA3(148MM/MI) , n = 63; PNPLA3(148II) , n = 62). AT fatty acid composition was determined in 50 volunteers homozygous for the variant (PNPLA3(148MM) , n = 25) or lacking the variant (PNPLA3(148II) , n = 25). Whole-body insulin sensitivity of lipolysis was determined using [(2) H5 ]glycerol, and PNPLA3 mRNA and protein levels were measured in subcutaneous AT and liver biopsies in a subset of the volunteers. RESULTS: PUFA-TGs were significantly increased in AT in carriers versus non-carriers of PNPLA3-I148M. The variant did not alter the rate of lipolysis or the composition of fasting serum NEFAs. PNPLA3 mRNA was 33-fold higher in the liver than in AT (P \u003c .0001). In contrast, PNPLA3 protein levels per tissue protein were three-fold higher in AT than the liver (P \u003c .0001) and nine-fold higher when related to whole-body AT and liver tissue masses (P \u003c .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to previous assumptions, PNPLA3 is highly abundant in AT. PNPLA3-I148M locally remodels AT TGs to become polyunsaturated as it does in the liver, without affecting lipolysis or composition of serum NEFAs. Changes in AT metabolism do not contribute to NAFLD in PNPLA3-I148M carriers.","tags":["adipose tissue"," fatty acids"," lipidomics"," lipolysis"," non-alcoholic fatty liver disease"," triglycerides"],"title":"The PNPLA3-I148M variant increases polyunsaturated triglycerides in human adipose tissue","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

In this study, we aim to explore the regulatory mechanisms and the clinical significance of autophagy-associated circRNAs in BC. METHODS: Autophagy associated circRNAs were screened by circRNAs deep sequencing and validated by qRT-PCR in BC tissues with high- and low- autophagic level. The biological function of autophagy associated circRNAs were assessed by plate colony formation, cell viability, transwells, flow cytometry and orthotopic animal models. For mechanistic study, RNA immunoprecipitation, circRNAs pull-down, Dual luciferase report assay, Western Blot, Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemical staining were performed. RESULTS: An autophagy associated circRNA circCDYL was elevated by 3.2 folds in BC tissues as compared with the adjacent non-cancerous tissues, and circCDYL promoted autophagic level in BC cells via the miR-1275-ATG7/ULK1 axis; Moreover, circCDYL enhanced the malignant progression of BC cells in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, increased circCDYL in the tumor tissues and serum of BC patients was associated with higher tumor burden, shorter survival and poorer clinical response to therapy.

In 148M homozygous individuals, triglycerides (TGs) in very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) were depleted of PUFAs both under fasting and postprandial conditions compared with 148I homozygotes, and the PUFA/SFA ratio in VLDL-TGs was lower relative to the chylomicron precursor pool. In human PNPLA3-148M and PNPLA3-KO cells, PUFA but not SFA incorporation into TGs was increased at the expense of phosphatidylcholines, and under lipolytic conditions, PUFA-containing diacylglycerols (DAGs) accumulated compared with PNPLA3-148I cells. Polyunsaturated TGs were increased, while phosphatidylcholines (PCs) were decreased in the human liver in 148M homozygous individuals as compared with 148I homozygotes.

A higher level of hsa_circ_001783 was significantly correlated with heavier tumor burden and poorer prognosis of patients with breast cancer. Knockdown of this circRNA remarkably inhibited the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells.

Here, we characterize the role of ORP2 in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism by employing ORP2-knockout (KO) hepatoma cells (HuH7) generated by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. The ORP2-KO and control HuH7 cells were subjected to RNA sequencing, analyses of Akt signaling, carbohydrate and TG metabolism, the extracellular acidification rate, and the lipidome, as well as to transmission electron microscopy. The loss of ORP2 resulted in a marked reduction of active phosphorylated Akt(Ser473) and its target Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta(Ser9), consistent with defective Akt signaling. ORP2 was found to form a physical complex with the key controllers of Akt activity, Cdc37, and Hsp90, and to co-localize with Cdc37 and active Akt(Ser473) at lamellipodial plasma membrane regions, in addition to the previously reported ER-LD localization. ORP2-KO reduced glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, mRNA-encoding glycolytic enzymes, and SREBP-1 target gene expression, and led to defective TG synthesis and storage. ORP2-KO did not reduce but rather increased ER-LD contacts under basal culture conditions and interfered with their expansion upon fatty acid loading. Together with our recently published work (Kentala et al. in FASEB J 32:1281-1295, 2018), this study identifies ORP2 as a new regulatory nexus of Akt signaling, cellular energy metabolism, actin cytoskeletal function, cell migration, and proliferation.","tags":["actin cytoskeleton/genetics/metabolism"," biological transport/genetics"," cell cycle proteins/genetics"," cell line"," cell movement/genetics"," cell proliferation/genetics"," chaperonins/genetics"," energy metabolism/genetics"," gene knockout techniques"," hsp90 heat-shock proteins"," humans"," lipid metabolism/genetics"," organelles/genetics/metabolism"," proto-oncogene proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism"," rna, messenger/genetics"," receptors, steroid/genetics"," signal transduction/genetics"," akt signaling"," crispr-cas9"," glycolysis"," osbp-related protein"," osbpl2"," triacylglycerol"],"title":"OSBP-related protein-2 (ORP2): a novel Akt effector that controls cellular energy metabolism","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this tutorial, I’ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 …\nTip 2 …\n","date":1536451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536451200,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"https://yz-lab.org/main/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/main/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I’ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 …\nTip 2 …","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["P.

Adipose tissue lipolysis and hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) are the main pathways contributing to IHTG. We hypothesized that dietary macronutrient composition influences the pathways, mediators, and magnitude of weight gain-induced changes in IHTG. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We overfed 38 overweight subjects (age 48 +/- 2 years, BMI 31 +/- 1 kg/m(2), liver fat 4.7 +/- 0.9%) 1,000 extra kcal/day of saturated (SAT) or unsaturated (UNSAT) fat or simple sugars (CARB) for 3 weeks. We measured IHTG ((1)H-MRS), pathways contributing to IHTG (lipolysis ([(2)H5]glycerol) and DNL ((2)H2O) basally and during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia), insulin resistance, endotoxemia, plasma ceramides, and adipose tissue gene expression at 0 and 3 weeks. RESULTS: Overfeeding SAT increased IHTG more (+55%) than UNSAT (+15%, P \u003c 0.05). CARB increased IHTG (+33%) by stimulating DNL (+98%). SAT significantly increased while UNSAT decreased lipolysis. SAT induced insulin resistance and endotoxemia and significantly increased multiple plasma ceramides. The diets had distinct effects on adipose tissue gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Macronutrient composition of excess energy influences pathways of IHTG: CARB increases DNL, while SAT increases and UNSAT decreases lipolysis. SAT induced the greatest increase in IHTG, insulin resistance, and harmful ceramides. Decreased intakes of SAT could be beneficial in reducing IHTG and the associated risk of diabetes.","tags":[],"title":"Saturated Fat Is More Metabolically Harmful for the Human Liver Than Unsaturated Fat or Simple Sugars","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

We addressed ORP2 function in hepatocytes by generating ORP2-knockout (KO) HuH7 cells by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, followed by analyses of transcriptome, F-actin morphology, migration, adhesion, and proliferation. RNA sequencing of ORP2-KO cells revealed \u003e2-fold changes in 579 mRNAs. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) uncovered alterations in the following functional categories: cellular movement, cell-cell signaling and interaction, cellular development, cellular function and maintenance, cellular growth and proliferation, and cell morphology. Many pathways in these categories involved actin cytoskeleton, cell migration, adhesion, or proliferation. Analysis of the ORP2 interactome uncovered 109 putative new partners. Their IPA analysis revealed Ras homolog A (RhoA) signaling as the most significant pathway. Interactions of ORP2 with SEPT9, MLC12, and ARHGAP12 were validated by independent assays. ORP2-KO resulted in abnormal F-actin morphology characterized by impaired capacity to form lamellipodia, migration defect, and impaired adhesion and proliferation. Rescue of the migration phenotype and generation of typical cell surface morphology required an intact ORP2 phosphoinositide binding site, suggesting that ORP2 function involves phosphoinositide binding and transport.

It binds phospholipids at its active site and physically interacts with lipid vesicles. When incubated with red blood cells membrane lipids are oxidized and hemolysis is induced but the structures of the oxygenated membrane lipids have not been determined. Using a lipidomic approach, we analyzed the formation of oxidized phospholipids generated during the in vitro incubation of recombinant PA-LOX with human erythrocytes and cultured human lung epithelial cells. Precursor scanning of lipid extracts prepared from these cells followed by multiple reaction monitoring and MS/MS analysis revealed a complex mixture of oxidation products. For human red blood cells this mixture comprised forty different phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine species carrying oxidized fatty acid residues, such as hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids, hydroxy- and keto-eicosatetraenoic acid, hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid as well as oxygenated derivatives of less frequently occurring polyenoic fatty acids. Similar oxygenation products were also detected when cultured lung epithelial cells were employed but here the amounts of oxygenated lipids were smaller and under identical experimental conditions we did not detect major signs of cell lysis. However, live imaging indicated an impaired capacity for trypan blue exclusion and an augmented mitosis rate. Taken together these data indicate that PA-LOX can oxidize the membrane lipids of eukaryotic cells and that the functional consequences of this reaction strongly depend on the cell type.","tags":["biomembranes"," eicosanoids"," fatty acids"," infectious diseases"," lipidomics"," oxidative stress"," phospholipids"],"title":"Specific oxygenation of plasma membrane phospholipids by Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipoxygenase induces structural and functional alterations in mammalian cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

It is strongly induced by insulin in vivo in WAT and in vitro in adipocytes. In this study we addressed the function of Angptl8 in adipocytes by its stable lentivirus-mediated knock-down in 3T3-L1 cells, followed by analyses of triglyceride (TG) storage, lipid droplet (LD) morphology, the cellular lipidome, lipolysis, and gene expression. Depletion of Angptl8 did not drastically affect the adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells but resulted in a moderate (18-19%) reduction of stored TGs. The lipidome analysis revealed a reduction of alkyl- phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) plasmalogens, as well as saturated PCs and PEs. Importantly, the Angptl8 depleted cells displayed enhanced lipolysis as measured by release of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). Consistently, mRNAs encoding Angptl4 and Leptin, which facilitate lipolysis, as well as Cpt1a, Cpt1b, and Pgc-1alpha involved in FA oxidation, were elevated. The Angptl8 mRNA itself was suppressed by pharmacologic treatments inducing lipolysis: stimulation with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol or with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin. To conclude, knock-down of Angptl8 in adipocytes suggests that the protein acts to inhibit intracellular lipolysis, analogous to its activity in the circulation. Depletion of Angptl8 results in an altered cellular phospholipid composition. The findings identify Angptl8 as a central insulin-regulated controller of adipocyte lipid metabolism.","tags":["angptl8"," ether phospholipids"," lipid storage"," lipidome"," lipolysis"," plasmalogen"," triglyceride"],"title":"Angiopoietin-like 8 (Angptl8) controls adipocyte lipolysis and phospholipid composition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

In this study, we aimed to determine: (1) the upper limit of normal HOMA-IR in two population-based cohorts; (2) the HOMA-IR corresponding to NAFLD; (3) the effect of sex and PNPLA3 genotype at rs738409 on HOMA-IR; and (4) inter-laboratory variations in HOMA-IR. METHODS: We identified healthy individuals in two population-based cohorts (FINRISK 2007 [n = 5024] and the Programme for Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes in Finland [FIN-D2D; n = 2849]) to define the upper 95th percentile of HOMA-IR. Non-obese individuals with normal fasting glucose levels, no excessive alcohol use, no known diseases and no use of any drugs were considered healthy. The optimal HOMA-IR cut-off for NAFLD (liver fat \u003e/=5.56%, based on the Dallas Heart Study) was determined in 368 non-diabetic individuals (35% with NAFLD), whose liver fat was measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Samples from ten individuals were simultaneously analysed for HOMA-IR in seven European laboratories. RESULTS: The upper 95th percentiles of HOMA-IR were 1.9 and 2.0 in healthy individuals in the FINRISK (n = 1167) and FIN-D2D (n = 459) cohorts. Sex or PNPLA3 genotype did not influence these values. The optimal HOMA-IR cut-off for NAFLD was 1.9 (sensitivity 87%, specificity 79%). A HOMA-IR of 2.0 corresponded to normal liver fat (\u003c5.56% on 1H-MRS) in linear regression analysis. The 2.0 HOMA-IR measured in Helsinki corresponded to 1.3, 1.6, 1.8, 1.8, 2.0 and 2.1 in six other laboratories. The inter-laboratory CV% of HOMA-IR was 25% due to inter-assay variation in insulin (25%) rather than glucose (5%) measurements. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The upper limit of HOMA-IR in population-based cohorts closely corresponds to that of normal liver fat. Standardisation of insulin assays would be the first step towards definition of normal values for HOMA-IR.","tags":["insulin"," liver fat"," nafld"," pnpla3"," reference values"],"title":"Use of HOMA-IR to diagnose non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a population-based and inter-laboratory study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["X.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic performance of gadoxetic acid disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI) and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) was performed in diagnosing small HCCs measuring up to 2 cm(0.05). Area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.9712 with Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and 0.8538 with MDCT. Regarding Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, sensitivity was significantly higher for studies from non-Asian countries than Asian countries(0.96 vs 0.93, p0.01), for retrospective studies than prospective studies(0.95 vs 0.91, p0.01), and for those with Gd-EOB-DTPA injection rate\u003e/=1.5ml/s than that of1.5ml/s (0.97 vs 0.90, p0.01).

Unlike common 'obese/metabolic' NAFLD, these subjects lack hypertriglyceridemia and have lower risk of cardiovascular disease. In animals, phosphatidylcholine (PC) deficiency results in a similar phenotype. PCs surround the core of VLDL consisting of triglycerides (TGs) and cholesteryl-esters (CEs). We determined the effect of the TM6SF2 E167K on these lipids in the human liver and serum and on hepatic gene expression and studied the effect of TM6SF2 knockdown on hepatocyte handling of these lipids. METHODS: Liver biopsies were taken from subjects characterized with respect to the TM6SF2 genotype, serum and liver lipidome, gene expression and histology. In vitro, after TM6SF2 knockdown in HuH-7 cells, we compared incorporation of different fatty acids into TGs, CEs, and PCs. RESULTS: The TM6SF2EK/KK and TM6SF2EE groups had similar age, gender, BMI and HOMA-IR. Liver TGs and CEs were higher and liver PCs lower in the TM6SF2EK/KK than the TM6SF2EE group (p\u003c0.05). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were deficient in liver and serum TGs and liver PCs but hepatic free fatty acids were relatively enriched in PUFA (p\u003c0.05). Incorporation of PUFA into TGs and PCs in TM6SF2 knockdown hepatocytes was decreased (p\u003c0.05). Hepatic expression of TM6SF2 was decreased in variant carriers, and was co-expressed with genes regulated by PUFAs. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic lipid synthesis from PUFAs is impaired and could contribute to deficiency in PCs and increased intrahepatic TG in TM6SF2 E167K variant carriers.","tags":["arachidonic acid"," cholesterol esters"," fatty acids"," genotype"," hepatocytes"," lipogenesis"," non-alcoholic fatty liver disease"," phosphatidylcholines"," transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2"," triglycerides"],"title":"Impaired hepatic lipid synthesis from polyunsaturated fatty acids in TM6SF2 E167K variant carriers with NAFLD","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.

Although in silico analysis, histopathologic evidence and functional verification indicated that both variants were deleterious, segregation with the patient phenotype established that the POLR1A defect underlies the disease, as a clinically unaffected sister also was homozygous for the OSBPL11 variant. Decreased nucleolar RPA194 was observed in the skin fibroblasts of only the affected brothers, whereas intracellular cholesterol accumulation was observed in the skin biopsies of the patients and the sister homozygous for the OSBPL11 variant. Our findings provide the first report showing a complex leukodystrophy associated with POLR1A. Variants in three other RNA polymerase subunits, POLR1C, POLR3A and POLR3B, are known to cause recessive leukodystrophy similar to the disease afflicting the present family but with a later onset. Of those, POLR1C is also implicated in a mandibulofacial dysostosis syndrome without leukodystrophy as POLR1A is.

We hypothesised that obesity/insulin resistance rather than liver fat increases circulating coagulation factor activities. We measured plasma prothrombin time (PT, Owren method), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), activities of several coagulation factors, VWF:RCo and fibrinogen, and D-dimer concentration in 92 subjects divided into groups based on insulin sensitivity [insulin-resistant ('IR') versus insulin-sensitive ('IS')] and PNPLA3 genotype (PNPLA3148MM/MI vs PNPLA3148II). Liver fat content (1H-MRS) was similarly increased in 'IR' (13 +/- 1 %) and PNPLA3148MM/MI (12 +/- 2 %) as compared to 'IS' (6 +/- 1 %, p\u003c0.05) and PNPLA3148II (8 +/- 1 %, p\u003c0.05), respectively. FVIII, FIX, FXIII, fibrinogen and VWF:RCo activities were increased, and PT and APTT shortened in 'IR' versus 'IS', in contrast to these factors being similar between PNPLA3148MM/MI and PNPLA3148II groups. In subjects undergoing a liver biopsy and entirely lacking the I148M variant, insulin-resistant subjects had higher hepatic expression of F8, F9 and FGG than equally obese insulin-sensitive subjects. Expression of pro-inflammatory genes in adipose tissue correlated positively with PT (% of normal), circulating FVIII, FIX, FXI, VWR:RCo and fibrinogen, and expression of anti-inflammatory genes negatively with PT (%), FIX and fibrinogen. We conclude that obesity/insulin resistance rather than an increase in liver fat is associated with a procoagulant plasma profile. This reflects adipose tissue inflammation and increased hepatic production of coagulation factors and their susceptibility for activation.","tags":["adipose tissue"," fibrinogen"," inflammation"," insulin"," non-alcoholic fatty liver disease"],"title":"Obesity/insulin resistance rather than liver fat increases coagulation factor activities and expression in humans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

We observed that IL-22 significantly reduced the proliferation of HSC and increased the expression of p-STAT3. beta-catenin was identified as a target gene of miR-200a by luciferase reporter assay, and upregulation of miR-200a significantly attenuated the proliferation of HSC and reduced beta-catenin expression.

The expression of p-STAT3 and miR-200a was elevated while beta-catenin was decreased in fibrotic rat liver after IL-22 treatment. Expression levels of beta-catenin and p-STAT3 were inversely correlated in fibrotic rat liver and HSC. Upregulation of beta-catenin suppressed expression of p-STAT3 in HSC.

We investigate whether MS-based profiling of plasma improves noninvasive risk estimates of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) compared with routinely available clinical parameters and patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) genotype at rs738409. METHODS: We used MS-based analytic platforms to measure levels of lipids and metabolites in blood samples from 318 subjects who underwent a liver biopsy because of suspected NASH. The subjects were divided randomly into estimation (n = 223) and validation (n = 95) groups to build and validate the model. Gibbs sampling and stepwise logistic regression, which fulfilled the Bayesian information criterion, were used for variable selection and modeling. RESULTS: Features of the metabolic syndrome and the variant in PNPLA3 encoding I148M were significantly more common among subjects with than without NASH. We developed a model to identify subjects with NASH based on clinical data and PNPLA3 genotype (NASH Clin Score), which included aspartate aminotransferase (AST), fasting insulin, and PNPLA3 genotype. This model identified subjects with NASH with an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.778 (95% confidence interval, 0.709-0.846). We then used backward stepwise logistic regression analyses of variables from the NASH Clin Score and MS-based factors associated with NASH to develop the NASH ClinLipMet Score. This included glutamate, isoleucine, glycine, lysophosphatidylcholine 16:0, phosphoethanolamine 40:6, AST, and fasting insulin, along with PNPLA3 genotype. It identified patients with NASH with an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.866 (95% confidence interval, 0.820-0.913). The NASH ClinLipMet score identified patients with NASH with significantly higher accuracy than the NASH Clin Score or MS-based profiling alone. CONCLUSIONS: A score based on MS (glutamate, isoleucine, glycine, lysophosphatidylcholine 16:0, phosphoethanolamine 40:6) and knowledge of AST, fasting insulin, and PNPLA3 genotype is significantly better than a score based on clinical or metabolic profiles alone in determining the risk of NASH.","tags":["diagnosis"," liver"," nonalcoholic fatty liver disease"," prediction"," triglycerides"],"title":"Noninvasive Detection of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Using Clinical Markers and Circulating Levels of Lipids and Metabolites","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

We aimed to establish a non-invasive score for prediction of NAFLD in Han Chinese, the largest ethnic group in the world, and detect whether ethnicity influences the accuracy of such a score. METHODS: Liver fat content (LFAT) was measured by quantitative ultrasound in 3548 subjects in the Shanghai Changfeng Community and a Chinese score was created using multivariate logistic regression analyses. This new score was internally validated in Chinese and externally in Finns. Its diagnostic performance was compared to the NAFLD liver fat score, fatty liver index (FLI) and hepatic steatosis index (HSI) developed in Finns, Italians and Koreans. We also analyzed how obesity related to LFAT measured by 1H-MRS in 79 Finns and 118 Chinese with type 2 diabetes (T2D). RESULTS: The metabolic syndrome and T2D, fasting serum insulin, body mass index (BMI) and AST/ALT ratio were independent predictors of NAFLD in Chinese. The AUROC in the Chinese validation cohort was 0.76 (0.73-0.78) and in Finns 0.73 (0.68-0.78) (p\u003c0.0001). 43%, 27%, 32% and 42% of Chinese had NAFLD when determined by the Chinese score, NAFLD liver fat score (p\u003c0.001 vs. Chinese score), FLI (p\u003c0.001) and HSI (NS). For any given BMI and waist circumference, the Chinese had a markedly higher LFAT than the Finns.

We determined which bioactive lipids co-segregate with IR in the human liver. METHODS: Liver lipidome was profiled in liver biopsies from 125 subjects that were divided into equally sized groups based on median HOMA-IR ('High and Low HOMA-IR', n=62 and n=63) or PNPLA3 genotype (PNPLA3(148MM/MI), n=61 vs. PNPLA3(148II), n=64). The subjects were also divided into 4 groups who had either IR, the I148M gene variant, both of the risk factors or neither. RESULTS: Steatosis and NASH prevalence were similarly increased in 'High HOMA-IR' and PNPLA3(148MM/MI) groups compared to their respective control groups. The 'High HOMA-IR' but not the PNPLA3(148MM/MI) group had features of IR. The liver in 'High HOMA-IR' vs. 'Low HOMA-IR' was markedly enriched in saturated and monounsaturated triacylglycerols and free fatty acids, dihydroceramides (markers of de novo ceramide synthesis) and ceramides. Markers of other ceramide synthetic pathways were unchanged. In PNPLA3(148MM/MI)vs. PNPLA3(148II), the increase in liver fat was due to polyunsaturated triacylglycerols while other lipids were unchanged. Similar changes were observed when data were analyzed using the 4 subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Similar increases in liver fat and NASH are associated with a metabolically harmful saturated, ceramide-enriched liver lipidome in 'Metabolic NAFLD' but not in 'PNPLA3 NAFLD'. This difference may explain why metabolic but not PNPLA3 NAFLD increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.","tags":["ceramides"," dihydroceramides"," free fatty acids"," insulin resistance"," non-alcoholic fatty liver disease"," non-alcoholic steatohepatitis"," pnpla3"," patatin-like phospholipase domain containing protein 3"],"title":"Hepatic ceramides dissociate steatosis and insulin resistance in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

In morbidly obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery preceded by a very low calorie diet, miR-192* in VAT correlated negatively (r=-0.387; p=0.046) with serum triglyceride (TG) and positively with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration (r=0.396; p=0.041). In a less obese patient cohort, the miRNA correlated negatively with the body mass index (r=-0.537; p=0.026). To characterize the function of miR-192*, we overexpressed it in cultured adipocytes and analyzed the expression of adipogenic differentiation markers as well as cellular TG content. Reduced TG and expression of the adipocyte marker proteins aP2 (adipocyte protein 2) and perilipin 1 were observed. The function of miR-192* was further investigated by transcriptomic profiling of adipocytes expressing this miRNA, revealing impacts on key lipogenic genes. A number of the mRNA alterations were validated by qPCR. Western analysis confirmed a marked reduction of the lipogenic enzyme SCD (stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase-1), the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH3A2 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member A2) and the high-density lipoprotein receptor SCARB1 (scavenger receptor B, type I). SCD and ALDH3A2 were demonstrated to be direct targets of miR-192*. To conclude, the present data identify miR-192* as a novel controller of adipocyte differentiation and lipid homeostasis.","tags":["adipogenesis"," obesity"," sgbs"," transcriptome"," mir-192-3p"],"title":"MicroRNA-192* impairs adipocyte triglyceride storage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

Target mRNAs and pathways were predicted for the miRNAs most significantly upregulated in NAFLD, their cell-type-specific expression was investigated by quantitative PCR (qPCR), and the transcriptome of immortalized human hepatocytes (IHH) transfected with the miRNA with the highest number of predicted targets, miR-576-5p, was studied. The screen revealed 42 miRNAs up- and two downregulated in the NAFLD as compared to non-NAFLD liver. The miRNAs differing most significantly between the groups, miR-103a-2*, miR-106b, miR-576-5p, miRPlus-I137*, miR-892a, miR-1282, miR-3663-5p, and miR-3924, were all upregulated in NAFLD liver.

Consistent transcriptome changes were observed in IHH transfected with miR-576-5p, and western analysis revealed a marked reduction of the RAC1 protein belonging to several miR-576-5p target pathways. To conclude, we identified 44 miRNAs differentially expressed in NAFLD versus non-NAFLD liver, 42 of these being novel in the context of NAFLD.

We aimed at studying how this variant influences circulating triacylglycerol (TAG) signatures and whether it influences hepatic or adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. METHODS: We genotyped 300 Finnish subjects for the E167K (rs58542926) variant in TM6SF2 and for the I148M (rs738409) variant in the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) in whom LFAT was measured using (1)H-MRS and circulating lipids by UPLC-MS. We compared the plasma lipidome between E167K carriers (TM6SF2(EK/KK)) and non-carriers (TM6SF2(EE)), and between three groups of NAFLD: (i) carriers of the E167K but not of the I148M variant in PNPLA3 ('TM6SF2 NAFLD'), (ii) carriers of the I148M but not of the E167K variant ('PNPLA3 NAFLD'), and (iii) non-carriers of either risk allele ('Non-risk NAFLD'). Hepatic and adipose tissue insulin sensitivities were measured using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique combined with infusion of [3-(3)H]glucose in 111 subjects. RESULTS: The LFAT content was 34% higher in the TM6SF2(EK/KK) (13.07+/-1.57%) than in the TM6SF2(EE) group (9.77+/-0.58%, p=0.013). The effect of insulin on glucose production and lipolysis were significantly higher in the TM6SF2(EK/KK) than in the TM6SF2(EE) group. Comparison of the three NAFLD groups with similar LFATs showed that both the 'TM6SF2 NAFLD' and 'PNPLA3 NAFLD' had significantly lower triglyceride levels and were characterized by lower levels of most common TAGs compared to the 'Non-risk NAFLD' group. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the E167K variant in TM6SF2 is associated with a distinct subtype of NAFLD, characterized by preserved insulin sensitivity with regard to lipolysis, hepatic glucose production and lack of hypertriglyceridemia despite a clearly increased LFAT content.","tags":["glucose production"," lipolysis"," liver"," magnetic resonance spectroscopy"," mass spectrometry"],"title":"Circulating triacylglycerol signatures and insulin sensitivity in NAFLD associated with the E167K variant in TM6SF2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.

Overexpression of Cripto-1 has been found to be correlated with tumorigenesis and may affect tumor recurrence and metastasis. The previous studies indicate that Cripto-1 might be a potential prognostic biomarker for several malignancies. The aim of this study is to examine Cripto-1 expression pattern and clinicopathological significance in human bladder cancer patients. We investigated Cripto-1 expression in 30 paired bladder cancer tissues and corresponding noncancerous bladder tissues using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Moreover, Cripto-1 expression in 130 bladder cancer specimens and bladder cancer T24 and 5637 cells were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assays. The recurrence/metastasis-free survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Cox regression was also used for univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors. The results showed that Cripto-1 expression is increased in bladder cancer tissues and is significantly associated with tumor size (P = 0.005) and tumor grade (P = 0.035). In addition, the expression level of Cripto-1 in bladder cancer was also found to be significantly associated with SRY-related HMG-box gene 2 expression (P = 0.003) and Ki-67 (P = 0.001). Compared with the patients with low Cripto-1 expression, the patients with high Cripto-1 expression had significantly poorer recurrence/metastasis-free survival (P = 0.011). Cox regression showed that Cripto-1 might be an independent prognostic factor for recurrence/metastasis-free survival (P = 0.036). Our findings suggest that high Cripto-1 expression might be involved in the development of bladder cancer and a potentially effective prognostic marker in bladder cancer patients.","tags":["adult"," aged"," aged, 80 and over"," disease-free survival"," female"," gpi-linked proteins/biosynthesis/genetics"," gene expression regulation, neoplastic"," humans"," intercellular signaling peptides and proteins/biosynthesis/genetics"," kaplan-meier estimate"," male"," middle aged"," neoplasm proteins/biosynthesis/genetics"," neoplasm recurrence, local/genetics/pathology"," prognosis"," urinary bladder neoplasms/genetics/pathology"],"title":"Cripto-1 expression and its prognostic value in human bladder cancer patients","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

We show that hyperphosphorylated ORP3 (ORP3-P) selectively interacts with the ER membrane protein VAPA, and ORP3-VAPA complexes are targeted to PM sites via the ORP3 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. A novel FFAT (two phenylalanines in an acidic tract)-like motif was identified in ORP3; only disruption of both the FFAT-like and canonical FFAT motif abolished the phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) stimulated interaction of ORP3-P with VAPA. Co-expression of ORP3 and VAPA induced R-Ras activation, dependent on the interactions of ORP3 with VAPA and the PM.

We examined whether and to what extent liver fat due to NAFLD influences liver volume. METHODS: We quantified the percentage of liver fat by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) H-MRS) and liver total, lean and fat volumes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 112 subjects (62 women, 50 men), who were characterized with respect to metabolic parameters associated with NAFLD. RESULTS: Of the subjects, 45% had NAFLD (liver fat 12.5 +/- 4.5% vs 1.8 +/- 1.6%, NAFLD vs no NAFLD, P \u003c 0.001). Total liver volume was 29% higher in subjects with NAFLD (1.91 +/- 0.45 L) than in those with no NAFLD (1.49 +/- 0.31 L, P \u003c 0.001). In multiple linear regression analysis, the percentage of liver fat and bodyweight independently explained variation in total liver volume (r(2) = 0.42, P \u003c 0.001). The r-values for the relationship between metabolic parameters and the total liver fat volume were not significantly better than those between metabolic parameters and the percentage of liver fat.

The diagnostic sensitivity (90%), negative predictive value (66.7%), and accuracy (91.7%) of CB immunohistochemistry were significantly higher than those of SC (70.0%, 30.0%, and 75.0%, respectively) and LBC (73.3%, 31.6%, and 77.8%, respectively) (all P\u003c0.05). The combination of CB and SC, or CB and LBC, did not significantly increase the efficacy compared to CB immunohistochemistry alone. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that in the absence of an on-site cytopathologist, CB immunohistochemistry on EUS-FNA specimens offers a higher diagnostic efficacy in patients with pancreatic lesions than does SC and LBC.","tags":["adult"," aged"," cytodiagnosis/methods"," endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration/methods"," female"," humans"," immunohistochemistry/methods"," male"," middle aged"," pancreas/pathology"," pancreatic neoplasms/diagnosis/metabolism/pathology"," predictive value of tests"," sensitivity and specificity"," young adult"],"title":"Diagnostic efficacy of cell block immunohistochemistry, smear cytology, and liquid-based cytology in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of pancreatic lesions: a single-institution experience","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

Diagnosis of NASH requires a liver biopsy. We estimated the prevalence of NASH non-invasively in a population-based study using scores validated against liver histology. METHODS: Clinical characteristics, PNPLA3 genotype at rs738409, and serum cytokeratin 18 fragments were measured in 296 consecutive bariatric surgery patients who underwent a liver biopsy to discover and validate a NASH score ('NASH score'). We also defined the cut-off for NASH for a previously validated NAFLD liver fat score to diagnose NASH in the same cohort ('NASH liver fat score'). Both scores were validated in an Italian cohort comprising of 380, mainly non-bariatric surgery patients, who had undergone a liver biopsy for NASH. The cut-offs were utilized in the Finnish population-based D2D-study involving 2849 subjects (age 45-74 years) to estimate the population prevalence of NASH. RESULTS: The final 'NASH Score' model included PNPLA3 genotype, AST and fasting insulin. It predicted NASH with an AUROC 0.774 (0.709, 0.839) in Finns and 0.759 (0.711, 0.807) in Italians (NS). The AUROCs for 'NASH liver fat score' were 0.734 (0.664, 0.805) and 0.737 (0.687, 0.787), respectively. Using 'NASH liver fat score' and 'NASH Score', the prevalences of NASH in the D2D study were 4.2% (95% CI: 3.4, 5.0) and 6.0% (5.0, 6.9%). Sensitivity analysis was performed by taking into account stochastic false-positivity and false-negativity rates in a Bayesian model. This analysis yielded population prevalences of NASH of 3.1% (95% stimulation limits 0.2-6.8%) using 'NASH liver fat score' and 3.6% (0.2-7.7%) using 'NASH Score'. CONCLUSIONS: The population prevalence of NASH in 45-74 year old Finnish subjects is approximately 5%.","tags":["alanine aminotransferase"," aspartate aminotransferase"," metabolic syndrome"," non-alcoholic fatty liver disease"," non-alcoholic steatohepatitis"," type 2 diabetes"],"title":"A population-based study on the prevalence of NASH using scores validated against liver histology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

The mechanisms of ORP function have remained incompletely understood. However, several ORPs are present at membrane contact sites and act as either lipid transporters or sensors that control lipid metabolism, cell signaling, and vesicle transport. Zebrafish, Danio rerio, has gained increasing popularity as a model organism in developmental biology, human disease, toxicology, and drug discovery. However, LTPs in the fish are thus far unexplored. In this article we report a series of bioinformatic analyses showing that the OSBPL gene family is highly conserved between the fish and human. The OSBPL subfamily structure is markedly similar between the two organisms, and all 12 human genes have orthologs, designated osbpl and located on 11 chromosomes in D. rerio. Interestingly, osbpl2 and osbpl3 are present as two closely related homologs (a and b), due to gene duplication events in the teleost lineage. Moreover, the domain structures of the distinct ORP proteins are almost identical between zebrafish and man, and molecular modeling in the present study suggests that ORD liganding by phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) is a feature conserved between yeast Osh3p, human ORP3, and zebrafish Osbpl3. The present analysis identifies D. rerio as an attractive model to study the functions of ORPs in vertebrate development and metabolism.","tags":["gene conservation"," lipid-binding protein"," orp"," osbpl"," phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate"," zebrafish"],"title":"A vertebrate model for the study of lipid binding/transfer protein function: conservation of OSBP-related proteins between zebrafish and human","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W.

The putative interaction was further confirmed by pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. ORP8 did not colocalize with kinetochore-associated SPAG5 in mitotic HepG2 or HuH7 cells, but overexpressed ORP8 was capable of recruiting SPAG5 onto endoplasmic reticulum membranes in interphase cells. In our experiments, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHC) retarded the HepG2 cell cycle, causing accumulation in G2/M phase; ORP8 overexpression resulted in the same phenotype. Importantly, ORP8 knock-down dramatically inhibited the oxysterol effect on HepG2 cell cycle, suggesting a mediating role of ORP8. Furthermore, knock-down of SPAG5 significantly reduced the effects of both ORP8 overexpression and 25OHC on the cell cycle, placing SPAG5 downstream of the two cell-cycle interfering factors. Taken together, the present results suggest that ORP8 may via SPAG5 mediate oxysterol interference of the HepG2 cell cycle.","tags":["blotting, western"," cell cycle/drug effects/physiology"," cell cycle proteins/metabolism"," fluorescent antibody technique"," hep g2 cells"," humans"," hydroxycholesterols/pharmacology"," immunoprecipitation"," microscopy, fluorescence"," receptors, steroid/metabolism"," subcellular fractions"," two-hybrid system techniques"," 25-hydroxycholesterol"," astrin"," cell cycle"," orp8"," oxysterol-binding protein"," spag5"],"title":"OSBP-related protein 8 (ORP8) interacts with Homo sapiens sperm associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) and mediates oxysterol interference of HepG2 cell cycle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

PNPLA3(WT) associated in PCA with newly synthesized [(13)C]TAGs, particularly 52:1 and 50:1, while PNPLA3(I148M) associated with similar preexisting TAGs. PNPLA3(WT) overexpression resulted in increased [D17]oleic acid labeling of TAGs during 24 h, and after longer incubations their turnover was accelerated, effects not detected with PNPLA3(I148M). PNPLA3(I148M) localized more extensively to lipid droplets (LDs) than PNPLA3(WT), suggesting that the substitution alters distribution of PNPLA3 between LDs and endoplasmic reticulum/cytosol. This study reveals a function of PNPLA3 in FA-selective TAG remodeling, resulting in increased TAG saturation. A defect in TAG remodeling activity likely contributes to the TAG accumulation observed in cells expressing PNPLA3(I148M).","tags":["adiponutrin"," lipase"," lipid droplet"," lipidomics"," nonalcoholic fatty liver disease"," patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3"],"title":"PNPLA3 mediates hepatocyte triacylglycerol remodeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Currently, no previous study explored the role of Th22 cells in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study aimed to determine the biological function of Th22 cells and its effector IL-22 in HCC patients. METHODS: Forty-five HCC patients and 19 healthy controls were recruited and their peripheral blood was collected. The fresh HCC tissues, adjacent HCC tissues and ten normal liver tissues were also collected. Flow cytometry analysis was used to determine the frequencies of circulating Th22 cells and Th17 cells. Serum IL-22 levels were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunohistochemical staining and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to detect IL-22 protein and mRNA in tissues specimens, respectively. RESULTS: Circulating Th22 cells, Th17 cells and serum IL-22 levels were significantly elevated in HCC patients compared with those of healthy controls (P\u003c0.001). Th22 cells were showed to be positively correlated with IL-22 in HCC patients (P\u003c0.05), but not in healthy controls. No significant differences were found in HCC patients with HBeAg positivity or negativity in term of Th22 cells and serum IL-22 levels. The expression of IL-22 protein and mRNA was highest in HCC tissues, followed by adjacent HCC tissues and normal liver tissues. Furthermore, Th22 cells, serum IL-22 levels and IL-22 mRNA were elevated at stage III-IV compared with stage I-II of HCC (P\u003c0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of circulating Th22 cells and IL-22 may be implicated in the pathogenesis of HCC, and potentially be cellular targets for therapeutic intervention.","tags":["il-22"," th22"," hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc)"],"title":"Th22 cells are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma development and progression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

The strengths of the association between IL-10 polymorphisms and IBS risk were estimated using odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Numerous epidemiological studies have evaluated the association of GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism with the risk of prostate cancer. However, the results remain inconclusive. To derive a more precise estimation, a meta-analysis was performed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A comprehensive search was conducted to identify the eligible studies. We used odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the strength of the relationship. The overall association was not significant (Val/Val vs. Ile/Ile OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.90-1.25, P = 0.50; Val/Val vs. Val/Ile+Ile/Ile: OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.91-1.25, P = 0.44). In subgroup analyses by ethnicity and prostate cancer grade, the similar results were observed. However, in stratified analysis by clinical stage, we found a significant association with low-stage prostate cancer (Val/Val vs. Ile/Ile: OR = 2.70, 95% CI = 1.73-4.22, P\u003c0.001; Val/Val vs. Val/Ile+Ile/Ile: OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.38-3.33, P = 0.001). Moreover, there was no statistically significant evidence of multiplicative interactions neither between the GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism and GSTM1, nor between smoking status and GSTP1 on prostate cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism might not be significantly associated with overall prostate cancer risk.

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a meta-analysis of observational studies to assess the association between baseline Lp(a) levels and the restenosis after successful coronary stenting. METHODS: We searched for studies without language restriction in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, Ovid library database prior to October 2012. Random-effects method was applied to estimate the pooled standard mean difference (SMD). Heterogeneity, sensitivity and subgroup analysis were used to evaluate the results. Meta-regression analysis was employed to investigate sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: 9 cohort studies including 1834 patients (600 ISR and 1234 no-ISR patients) were eligible for our analysis. Overall, we found significantly elevated baseline Lp(a) levels in ISR (in-stent restenosis) patients (SMD = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.14-0.71, P = 0.003). High heterogeneity existed between the individual studies (P \u003c 0.001, I(2) = 86.9%). The association was stronger in the Asian population than the overall association found. Further, similar observations were made in the subgroup with drug-eluting stent and the group in which Lp(a) was assayed by immunoturbidimetry. Multivariable regression analysis suggested that ethnicity was the major source of heterogeneity in the data (P = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that significantly elevated baseline plasma Lp(a) level is associated with ISR. The Lp(a) level appears to be a good predictor of ISR, especially in the Asian population or patients who received drug-eluting stent implantation. Further research is warranted to evaluate the association by taking the ethnicity and type of stent into account.","tags":[],"title":"Association between baseline lipoprotein (a) levels and restenosis after coronary stenting: meta-analysis of 9 cohort studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

According to the cancer stem cell (CSC) theory, the overexpression of Sox2 is potentially involved in carcinogenesis and could affect tumor recurrence and metastasis. Previous study proved Sox2 might be prognostic marker for multiple human malignancies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological significance of Sox2 expression in human non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. We examined Sox2 expression in 32 paired non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qrtRT-PCR). In addition, we analyzed Sox2 and Ki-67 expression in 126 non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer samples and bladder cancer cell line T24 by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assays. The recurrence-free survival was determined by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Cox regression was adopted for univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors. The expression of Sox2 was significantly increased in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer tissues. Sox2 expression was significantly correlated with that of Ki-67 (P \u003c 0.001). The expression of Sox2 was significantly associated with tumor size (P = 0.006), tumor number (P = 0.037), and tumor grade (P \u003c 0.001). Patients with high Sox2 expression had significantly poorer recurrence-free survival (P = 0.0002) when compared with patients with the low expression of Sox2. On multivariate analysis, Sox2 expression and tumor grade were found to be independent prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival (P \u003c 0.05). Our data suggested for the first time that the high expression of Sox2 may contribute to the development of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and serve as a novel prognostic marker in patients with T1 bladder cancer.","tags":[],"title":"Predictive value of Sox2 expression in transurethral resection specimens in patients with T1 bladder cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

We conducted a meta-analysis for candidate genes to provide the evidences for the current understanding of the genetic association with GBS. METHODS: We searched relevant studies without language restriction in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane library through May 2011. The strengths of the associations between genetic variants and GBS risk were estimated by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Random-effects models or fixed effects model was applied based on the heterogeneity test. RESULTS: We identified 12 case-control studies involving 1,590 GBS cases and 2,154 controls for the analysis. Because of limited eligible data, our meta-analysis specifically focused on 6 genetic variants of 3 candidate genes, TNF-alpha, FcgammaR and CD1. We found that TNF-alpha 308 G/A polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of GBS in the overall population (GG+GA vs. AA: OR=0.32, 95%CI=0.16-0.62; GG vs. AA: OR=0.36, 95%CI=0.19-0.68).

In addition, we did not observe significant associations between FcgammaRIIA R/H, FcgammaRIIIA F/V, FcgammaRIIIB NA1/NA2, CD1A 1/2 and CD1E 1/2 polymorphisms and susceptibility for developing GBS.

All of the ORP mRNAs were present in the s.c and visceral adipose tissues, and the two depots shared an almost identical ORP mRNA expression pattern. SGBS adipocytes displayed a similar pattern, suggesting that the adipose tissue ORP expression pattern mainly derives from adipocytes. During SGBS cell adipogenic differentiation, ORP2, ORP3, ORP4, ORP7, and ORP8 mRNAs were down-regulated, while ORP11 was induced. To assess the impacts of ORPs on adipocyte differentiation, ORP3 and ORP8, proteins down-regulated during adipogenesis, were overexpressed in differentiating SGBS adipocytes, while ORP11, a protein induced during adipogenesis, was silenced. ORP8 overexpression resulted in reduced expression of the aP2 mRNA, while down-regulation of adiponectin and aP2 was observed in ORP11 silenced cells. Furthermore, ORP8 overexpression or silencing of ORP11 markedly decreased cellular triglyceride storage.

METHODS: Eligible studies published up to May 2011 were retrieved via both computer searches and manual review of references. Random-effects models were used to calculate summary relative risk estimates (SRRE) based on high-contrast to low-intake values. Sensitivity and influence analyses were conducted, and heterogeneity among study results was explored through stratified analyses by study design, gender, geographic region, year of publication, or whether or not adjustment for several confounders (ie, age, gender, body mass index, smoking, and total energy intake). RESULTS: We extracted data from 14 studies on milk (involving 4879 cases) and 6 studies on dairy products (3087 cases). The total study population was up to 324,241 individuals. Overall, there was no significant association between milk intake and bladder cancer (SRRE 0.89, 95% CI 0.77-1.02). However, an inverse association was found in the United States (SRRE 0.88, 95% CI .79-.99).

CONCLUSION: There appears to be enough evidence to support the null hypothesis. The overall result was not statistically significant. The findings of this meta-analysis are not supportive of an independent relationship between the intake of milk or dairy products and the risk of bladder cancer.

In this study, we identified by yeast two-hybrid screening an interaction partner of ORP7, GATE-16, which (i) regulates Golgi SNARE of 28kDa (GS28) function and stability, and (ii) plays a role in autophagosome biogenesis. The interaction was confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay in living cells. The interacting regions were delineated within aa 1-142 of ORP7 and aa 30-117 of GATE-16. ORP7 knock-down in 293A cells resulted in a 40% increase of GS28 protein while ORP7 overexpression had the opposite effect (25% decrease of GS28). We show evidence that the regulation of GS28 by ORP7 does not occur at the level of transcription, but involves degradation of GS28 on proteasomes. Truncated ORP7 that lacks the GATE-16 binding region failed to affect GS28 stability, evidencing for specificity of the observed effect. Similar to ORP7 overexpression, treatment of cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH) resulted in GS28 destabilization, which was potentiated by excess ORP7 and inhibited by ORP7 silencing. Overexpression of ORP7 led in most cells to formation of vacuolar structures positive for RFP-LC3, thus representing autophagic elements. Also GATE-16 was found in the vacuolar ORP7-positive elements, suggesting that excess ORP7 increases entrapment of GATE-16 in autophagosomes. Taken together, our results suggest that ORP7 negatively regulates GS28 protein stability via sequestration of GATE-16, and may mediate the effect of 25-OH on GS28 and Golgi function.","tags":[],"title":"OSBP-related protein 7 interacts with GATE-16 and negatively regulates GS28 protein stability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.

Numerous epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and the risk of cancer. However, the results of these studies on the association remain conflicting. To derive a more precise estimation of the association, we conducted a meta-analysis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A comprehensive search was conducted to identify the eligible studies of hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and cancer risk. We used odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the strength of the association. We found that the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism was significantly associated with overall cancer risk (Cys/Cys vs. Ser/Ser: OR = 1.19, 95%CI = 1.09-1.30, P\u003c0.001; Cys/Cys vs. Cys/Ser+Ser/Ser: OR = 1.16, 95%CI = 1.08-1.26, P\u003c0.001). Moreover, in subgroup analyses by cancer types, the stronger significant association between hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and lung cancer risk was found (Cys/Cys vs. Ser/Ser: OR = 1.29, 95%CI = 1.16-1.44, P\u003c0.001; Cys/Cys vs. Cys/Ser+Ser/Ser: OR = 1.22, 95%CI = 1.12-1.33, P\u003c0.001). The significant effects of hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism on colorectal, breast, bladder, prostate, esophageal, and gastric cancer were not detected. In addition, in subgroup analyses by ethnicities, we found that the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism was associated with overall cancer risk in Asians (Cys/Cys vs. Ser/Ser: OR = 1.21, 95%CI = 1.10-1.33, P\u003c0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that hOGG1 326Cys allele might be a low-penetrant risk factor for lung cancer.","tags":["asian continental ancestry group/genetics"," case-control studies"," dna glycosylases/genetics"," genetic predisposition to disease"," genotype"," humans"," neoplasms/etiology"," polymorphism, genetic/genetics"," risk factors"],"title":"The effect of hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism on cancer risk: evidence from a meta-analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

ORP11 is present at highest levels in human ovary, testis, kidney, liver, stomach, brain, and adipose tissue. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates abundant ORP11 in the epithelial cells of kidney tubules, testicular tubules, caecum, and skin. ORP11 in HEK293 cells resides on Golgi complex and LE, co-localizing with GFP-Rab9, TGN46, GFP-Rab7, and a fluorescent medial-trans-Golgi marker. Under electron microscopic observation, cells overexpressing ORP11 displayed lamellar lipid bodies associated with vacuolar structures or the Golgi complex, indicating a disturbance of lipid trafficking. N-terminal fragment of ORP11 (aa 1-292) localized partially to Golgi, but displayed enhanced localization on Rab7- and Rab9-positive LE, while the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (aa 273-747) was cytosolic, demonstrating that the membrane targeting determinants are N-terminal. Yeast two-hybrid screen revealed interaction of ORP11 with the related ORP9. The interacting region was delineated within aa 98-372 of ORP9 and aa 154-292 of ORP11. Overexpressed ORP9 was able to recruit EGFP-ORP11 to membranes, and ORP9 silencing inhibited ORP11 Golgi association. The results identify ORP11 as an OSBP homologue distributing at the Golgi-LE interface and define the ORP9-ORP11 dimer as a functional unit that may act as an intracellular lipid sensor or transporter.","tags":["binding sites"," blotting, western"," cell line"," endosomes/metabolism/ultrastructure"," gene silencing"," golgi apparatus/metabolism/ultrastructure"," green fluorescent proteins/metabolism"," humans"," immunohistochemistry"," lipids/chemistry"," organ specificity"," phosphatidylinositols/metabolism"," protein binding"," protein interaction mapping"," protein multimerization"," protein structure, tertiary"," protein transport"," receptors, steroid/chemistry/metabolism"," subcellular fractions/metabolism"," vacuoles/metabolism/ultrastructure"],"title":"OSBP-related protein 11 (ORP11) dimerizes with ORP9 and localizes at the Golgi-late endosome interface","type":"publication"},{"authors":["V.

We confirmed the interaction by GST pull down, coimmunoprecipitation and confocal immunofluorescence analysis in cells with transient expression of NS5B and M2PK as well as in a HCV replicon-bearing cell line. Furthermore shRNA which specifically down-regulated M2PK expression could inhibit the replication of HCV in HCV replicon 9B cells.","tags":["animals"," cell line"," genome, viral"," hepacivirus/genetics/metabolism"," humans"," isoenzymes/metabolism"," mice"," pyruvate kinase/genetics/metabolism"," replicon"," two-hybrid system techniques"," viral nonstructural proteins/metabolism"],"title":"Isoform-specific interaction of pyruvate kinase with hepatitis C virus NS5B","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://yz-lab.org/main/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/main/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/img/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
